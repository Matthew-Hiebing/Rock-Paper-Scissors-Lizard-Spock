# React Rock Paper Scissors Variant

This project was built to get more practice using React hooks.  It is based off a problem I came across on Codewars called, "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" where I had to come up with the logic that deciphered how to check whether a user "won" or not.  The project is hosted on Heroku [here](https://rock-paper-scissors-l-s.herokuapp.com/).  The server may take some time to spin up, please be patient and/or refresh the page if its not working.  Once its loaded, check it out and play few games!

## Installation
First install [node](https://math-game-react-frontend.herokuapp.com/).  Although most of the packages below should be included with `npx create-react-app my-app`, make sure you have the following packages installed prior to running `npm start`:

```bash
npm install react 18.2.0
npm install react-dom 18.2.0
npm install react-scripts 5.0.1
```

### Here's an example of what the game page should look like once you're logged in.
